Table of all hot keys, macros, and On Key Label assignments
===

The third page of the Thor form (**Tool Definitions**) displays a grid of all hot keys that have been assigned in Thor for popup menus and tools as well as all keyboard macros and On Key Label definitions.  (While Thor does not manage the keyboard macros or On Key Label definitions, it is very handy to see all of these different definitions in one place.)

Clicking on a column header will sort by that column.  Note that there are ***two*** different sorts available for the first column; consecutive clicks on the column heading will alternate between these two sorts.

For rows that are controlled by Thor (the bold rows), double-clicking on a row will allow you to re-define the hot key assigned.  To remove the hot key assignment, use the right-click context menu on the row.
