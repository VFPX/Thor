First-Time and Manual Installation of Thor
===

*Note:* starting with Thor Version 1.1, Thor updates can be obtained by using [One-Click Update of Thor](Thor_one-click_update.md). This page only applies to the **initial installation** of Thor or should it happen that the One-Click Update is not working.

### **Installing Thor**

1. [**Download current version of Thor**](https://github.com/VFPX/Thor/archive/master.zip).
2. Extract "Thor" sub-folder from the ZIP file to the installation folder of your choice (see details below on how to choose an installation folder). After this step your installation folder should only contain "Source" sub-folder and the Thor.APP.
3. Open Visual FoxPro and run the following commands in the command window:  


    Clear All
    Do [C:\Path\To\ThorInstallFolder\Thor.APP]

or, in case your Thor installation folder is in your PATH, simply:


    Clear All
    Do Thor.APP

The command does couple of things.

*   Creates a folder named Thor in the installation folder.
*   Creates some sub-folders and files in that folder.
*   Updates the VFP system menu by adding a menu pad for Thor.
*   Automatically runs ["Check for Updates"](Thor_one-click_update.md) so that you can download and install [PEM Editor](https://github.com/VFPX/PEMEditor) and [The Thor Repository](Thor_repository.md), which are required components to run Thor.
*   And finally opens up the Thor Launcher.

*Note:* Thor does not affect VFP in any other way (it does not SET any variables, modify foxcode, etc.) and the installation process can be safely repeated as many times as desired.

#### Choosing an installation folder

Thor must be installed into permanent folder; it creates some folders and tables which must always be available. We suggest to install Thor into a folder that is backed up on a regular basis. The installation folder doesn't need to be a VFP sub-folder. 

There are two different strategies when selecting an installation folder for Thor:

1.  Install it in a common folder (such as in your PATH), so that Thor.APP can be easily accessible
2.  Install it in its own separate folder, and then use [RunThor.PRG](Thor_running.md) to access Thor.APP
