Gauge

Project Manager: Doug Hennig

People like visual images. Most people would rather see a chart than columns of raw numbers because it’s easier to see the relationships between items visually. Adding analysis tools like charts and gauges to your applications make them much more valuable to your users.

What is a gauge? A gauge is an image that shows how a single value compares to a maximum or goal value. The two values can be anything: current sales compared to budget, volume to date compared to the maximum allowable volume, and so on. For example, many charitable organizations show the current status of their fund raising campaigns as a thermometer. The top of the thermometer represents the value of the fund raising goal and the height of the bar inside the thermometer represents how much money has been raised so far.
